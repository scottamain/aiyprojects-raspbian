aiy.assistant
=============

A collection of modules that simplify interaction with the
`Google Assistant API <https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/>`_.

These APIs are designed for the Voice Kit, but have no dependency on the Voice
HAT/Bonnet specifically. However, they do require some type of sound card
attached to the Raspberry Pi that can be detected by the ALSA subsystem.
