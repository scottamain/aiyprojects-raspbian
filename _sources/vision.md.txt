# Vision Kit overview

<img src="_static/images/vision-kit.png" class="attempt-right" alt=""

The AIY Vision Kit is a do-it-yourself intelligent camera built with a
Raspberry Pi and the Vision Bonnet.

After you assemble the kit and run the included demos,
you can extend the kit with your own software and hardware.

Also see the [Vision Kit assembly guide](
https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/vision/).

## API modules

To execute ML models and perform other actions with the Vision Kit, the
system image includes the ``aiy`` Python library with the following modules
designed for the Vision Kit:

* [`aiy.toneplayer`](aiy.toneplayer.html):
A simple melodic music player for the piezo buzzer.
* [`aiy.trackplayer`](aiy.trackplayer.html):
A tracker-based music player for the piezo buzzer.
* [`aiy.vision.annotator`](aiy.vision.annotator.html):
An annotation library that draws overlays on the Raspberry Pi’s camera preview.
* [`aiy.vision.inference`](aiy.vision.inference.html):
An inference engine that communicates with the Vision Bonnet from the Raspberry
Pi side.
* [`aiy.vision.models`](aiy.vision.models.html):
A collection of modules that perform ML inferences with specific types of image
classification and object detection models.
* [`aiy.board`](aiy.board.html):
APIs to use the button that’s attached to the Vision Bonnet’s button connector.
* [`aiy.leds`](aiy.leds.html):
APIs to control certain LEDs, such as the LEDs in the button and the privacy
LED.
* [`aiy.pins`](aiy.pins.html):
Pin definitions for the bonnet's extra GPIO pins, for use with gpiozero.


## Bonnet hardware

The Voice Kit includes the following Voice Bonnet hardware.

* SOC: Myriad 2450
* MCU: ATSAMD09D14 [I2C address: 0x51]
* LED Driver: KTD2027A [I2C address: 0x30]
* Crypto (optional): ATECC608A [I2C address: 0x60]
* IMU: BMI160

### Drivers

* MCU driver: `modinfo aiy-io-i2c`
* MCU PWM driver: `modinfo pwm-aiy-io`
* MCU GPIO driver: `modinfo gpio-aiy-io`
* MCU ADC driver: `modinfo aiy-adc`
* LED driver: `modinfo leds-ktd202x`
* Software PWM driver for buzzer: `modinfo pwm-soft`
* Myriad driver: `modinfo aiy-vision`

To reset MCU:
```
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/bus/i2c/devices/1-0051/reset
```

To get MCU status message (including firmware version) and last error code:
```
cat /sys/bus/i2c/devices/1-0051/{status_message,error_code}
```
